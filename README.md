## 📊 Key Insights and Visualizations

### 1️⃣ **Distribution of Listing Prices**

- A histogram with KDE was used to visualize the distribution of listing prices.
- **Key Insight**: Most listings are priced within a specific range, with a few outliers.

### 2️⃣ **Room Type Distribution**

- A bar chart was created to show the count of different room types.
- **Key Insight**: Certain room types are more popular than others.

### 3️⃣ **Listings Across Neighborhoods**

- A count plot was used to display the number of listings by neighborhood group.
- **Key Insight**: Some neighborhoods have significantly more listings than others.

### 4️⃣ **Price vs Room Type**

- A boxplot was used to analyze the relationship between room type and price.
- **Key Insight**: Different room types have distinct price ranges.

### 5️⃣ **Trends in Reviews Over Time**

- A line plot was created to show the number of reviews over time.
- **Key Insight**: The number of reviews fluctuates over time, indicating trends in user activity.

## 🧹 Data Cleaning Steps

1. **Handle Missing Values**:
   - Convert the `last review` column to datetime format.
   - Fill missing values in `reviews per month` with `0` and `last review` with the earliest date.
   - Drop rows with missing values in critical columns like `NAME`, `host name`, `country`, and `country code`.
2. **Remove Unnecessary Columns**:
   - Drop columns like `license` and `house_rules` if they exist.
3. **Clean Price Data**:
   - Remove dollar signs and commas from `price` and `service fee` columns and convert them to numeric types.
4. **Remove Duplicates**:
   - Ensure data consistency by dropping duplicate rows.
